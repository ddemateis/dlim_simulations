The repository contains scripts to recreate the simulaitons in "Penalized Distributed Lag Interaction Model: Air Pollution, Birth Weight and Neighborhood Vulnerability" which can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02939. Files are named according to which table they recreate. For example, the file "maintext_tables_1_2.R" recreates the simulation results presented in Tables 1 and 2 in the main text.
